# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Caelan’s research is motivated by complex fire phenomena with a focus on industrial and environmental applications and focused on development of open-source tools for efficient simulation and optimization of such problems. Because these problems typically involve large ranges in length and time scales, computational techniques to address this disparity can be used. Using adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), a computational mesh can be changed while a simulation is running to increase physical resolution in specific areas of interest, concentrating computational power where it is most needed. Work to date has involved applying AMR to model complex fire problems within the open-source computational fluid dynamics software OpenFOAM. Future work will incorporate efficient outer-loop processes (e.g. adjoint optimization, approximate bayesian computation) to fire suppression and parameter identification problems.

Caelan was first funded by gift support from the 3M corporation. Since then, he has been funded by an NSF graduate research fellowship (Grant No. NSF GRFP, DGE 1144083).
